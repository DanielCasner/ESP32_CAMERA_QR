 Rewritten for C by Daniel Casner, March 2019

 This library allows an Arduino to read from the MPL3115A2 low-cost high-precision pressure sensor.

 If you have feature suggestions or need support please use the github support page: https://github.com/sparkfun/MPL3115A2_Breakout

 Hardware Setup: The MPL3115A2 lives on the I2C bus. Attach the SDA pin to A4, SCL to A5. Use inline 10k resistors
 if you have a 5V board. If you are using the SparkFun breakout board you *do not* need 4.7k pull-up resistors
 on the bus (they are built-in).

 Link to the breakout board product:

 Software:
 .begin() Gets sensor on the I2C bus.
 .readAltitude() Returns float with meters above sealevel. Ex: 1638.94
 .readAltitudeFt() Returns float with feet above sealevel. Ex: 5376.68
 .readPressure() Returns float with barometric pressure in Pa. Ex: 83351.25
 .readTemp() Returns float with current temperature in Celsius. Ex: 23.37
 .readTempF() Returns float with current temperature in Fahrenheit. Ex: 73.96
 .setModeBarometer() Puts the sensor into Pascal measurement mode.
 .setModeAltimeter() Puts the sensor into altimetery mode.
 .setModeStandy() Puts the sensor into Standby mode. Required when changing CTRL1 register.
 .setModeActive() Start taking measurements!
 .setOversampleRate(unsigned char) Sets the # of samples from 1 to 128. See datasheet.
 .enableEventFlags() Sets the fundamental event flags. Required during setup.
